Developing Web3: Coding with modern blockchains & protocols from the ground up

Interested in Web3, blockchain, cryptocurrencies or NFT's but overwhelmed by the options on where to
begin your developer journey? Attend this fully hands-on, highly interactive session to get a
comprehensive understanding of what developing solutions for Web3 involves. We'll begin with the
fundamental concepts you need to know regardless of which blockchain project strikes your fancy. Then
you'll get an overview of the various ledger services available on Azure, before diving into building your
own smart contracts and dApps using familiar tools like Visual Studio Code against the latest and most
popular blockchains including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, Polygon and Cosmos. You'll leave
having gained cross-cutting knowledge on the architectures, tools and programming languages you need
to use to succeed in developing Web3 solutions. 

By the end of this talk, this will make sense to you:

"You can also purchase ERN using MATIC with QuickSwap on Polygon.
